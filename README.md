# cipher-magic

Create a software project that includes two main functionalities: 
1. Encrypting and decrypting text files using the VigenÃ¨re cipher. The program will be written in C/C++ and feature a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. The user can select a file to encrypt with a given key, and similarly, decrypt files using the appropriate key.
2. A feature to break the VigenÃ¨re cipher through statistical analysis, aiming to recover both the original text and the key. This component will utilize the frequency of letters in the English language to perform cryptanalysis on encrypted messages without the key.

The GUI should be user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate through encryption, decryption, and cipher-breaking functionalities. A visual representation of the statistical analysis during the cipher-breaking process would be an added advantage, providing insights into the decryption process. The software aims to be a comprehensive tool for both secure communication and educational purposes in understanding classical encryption methods.
